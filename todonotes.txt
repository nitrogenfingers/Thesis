	Dislike the title. Needs to change to reflect content better.
	Title page off-center from footer. Check on a work machine
	Update Copyright to 2016
Dedication
	Clumsily worded
Abstract

	Significance:
		- Chop. Not part of this aspect of the thesis.
Chapter 2 and 3
	To be ACTUALLY FUCKING WRITTEN
Header
	- Why is second page onward using &section title? Issue with all chapters.
Chapter 4
	- Equations on 20 very messy. Clean up.
		- Center
		- Make bolding consistent and less ugly
		- Increase size, or spacing, or something.
	- Conclusion page. Needs to be summarized and explained.
Chapter 5
	- Floating margins on description environment in 5.2
	- Titles are wrong. Reorganize section/subsection titles

- hyphenation overkill in "description" environments
