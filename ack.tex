\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}
I wish to acknowledge the role my supervisors had in assisting me in penning
this thesis; my primary supervisor Prof. Tom Gedeon for his research expertise,
guidance and instruction that ensured both my research and my publications were
successful. My co-supervisor Richard Jones was invaluable in the preparation of
my work and managing the project. 

I also wish to acknowledge other members in my the iHCC research group and my
peer group, especially Sabrina Caldwell for providing direction in my research
and acting both as a participant in my experiments and proof-reader of much of
my work.

Finally, I acknowledge and thank the many friends I've made at ANU for their
past and continued support, and for making the years I spent as a PhD student as
enjoyable as they were.
