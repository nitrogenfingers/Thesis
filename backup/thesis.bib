   abstract = {This paper presents neural network-based dimension reduction of texture features in content-based image retrieval. In particular, we highlight the usefulness of hetero-associative neural networks to this task, and also propose a scheme to combine the hetero-associative and auto-associative functions. A multichannel Gabor-filtering approach is used to derive 30-dimensional texture features from a set of homogeneous texture images. Multi-layer feedforward neural networks are then trained to reduce the number of feature dimensions. Our results show that the methods lead to a reduction of up to 30% while keeping or even improving the performance of similarity ranking. This has the benefit of alleviating the ill-effects of the high dimensionality of features in current image indexing methods and resulting in significant speeding up retrieval rates. Results using principal component analysis are also provided for comparison.},

   abstract = {Previous evidence suggests that eye-contact serves a number of different functions in two-person encounters, of which one of the most important is gathering feed-back on the other person's reactions. It is further postulated that eye-contact is linked to affiliate motivation, and that approach and avoidance forces produce an equilibrium level of physical proximity, eye contact and other aspects of intimacy. If one of these is disturbed, compensatory changes may occur along the other dimensions. Experiments are reported which suggest that people move towards an equilibrium distance, and adopt a particular level of eye-contact. As predicted, there was less eye contact and glances were shorter, the closer two subjects were placed together (where one member of each pair was a confederate who gazed continuously at the other). The effect was greatest for opposite-sex pairs. In another experiment it was found that subjects would stand closer to a second person when his eyes were shut, as predicted by the theory.},

   abstract = {A fundamental approach of cognitive science is to understand cognitive systems by separating them into modules. Theoretical reasons are described which force any system which learns to perform a complex combination of real-time functions into a modular architecture. Constraints on the way modules divide up functionality are also described. The architecture of such systems, including biological systems, is constrained into a form called the recommendation architecture, with a primary separation between clustering and competition. Clustering is a modular hierarchy which manages the interactions between functions on the basis of detection of functionally ambiguous repetition. Change to previously detected repetitions is limited in order to maintain a meaningful, although partially ambiguous, context for all modules which make use of the previously defined repetitions. Competition interprets the repetition conditions detected by clustering as a range of alternative behavioural recommendations, and uses consequence feedback to learn to select the most appropriate recommendation. The requirements imposed by functional complexity result in very specific structures and processes which resemble those of brains. The design of an implemented electronic version of the recommendation architecture is described, and it is demonstrated that the system can heuristically define its own functionality, and learn without disrupting earlier learning. The recommendation architecture is compared with a range of alternative cognitive architectural proposals, and the conclusion reached that it has substantial potential both for understanding brains and for designing systems to perform cognitive functions.},

   abstract = {A machine with human-like consciousness would be an extremely complex system. Prior work has demonstrated that the way in which information handling resources are organized (the resource architecture) in an extremely complex learning system is constrained within some specific bounds if the available resources are limited, and that there is evidence that the human brain has been constrained in this way. An architectural concept is developed for a conscious machine that is within the architectural bounds imposed by resource limitations. This architectural concept includes a resource driven architecture, a description of how conscious phenomena would be supported by information processes within that architecture, and a description of actual implementations of the key information processes. Other approaches to designing a conscious machine are reviewed. The conclusion is reached that although they could be capable of supporting human consciousness-like phenomena, they do not take into account the architectural bounds imposed by resource limitations. Systems implemented using these approaches to learn a full range of cognitive features including human-like consciousness would therefore require more information handling resources, could have difficulty learning without severe interference with prior learning, and could require add-on subsystems to support some conscious phenomena that emerge naturally as consequences of a resource driven architecture.},

In addition, no algorithm presented in the literature has been tested on more than a handful of object categories. We present an method for learning object categories from just a few training images. It is quick and it uses prior information in a principled way. We test it on a dataset composed of images of objects belonging to 101 widely varied categories. Our proposed method is based on making use of prior information, assembled from (unrelated) object categories which were previously learnt. A generative probabilistic model is used, which represents the shape and appearance of a constellation of features belonging to the object. The parameters of the model are learnt incrementally in a Bayesian manner. Our incremental algorithm is compared experimentally to an earlier batch Bayesian algorithm, as well as to one based on maximum likelihood. The incremental and batch versions have comparable classification performance on small training sets, but incremental learning is significantly faster, making real-time learning feasible. Both Bayesian methods outperform maximum likelihood on small training sets.},

   pages = {128-135},
   abstract = {All natural cognitive systems, and, in particular, our own, gradually forget previously learned information. Plausible models of human cognition should therefore exhibit similar patterns of gradual forgetting of old information as new information is acquired. Only rarely does new learning in natural cognitive systems completely disrupt or erase previously learned information; that is, natural cognitive systems do not, in general, forget ‘catastrophically’. Unfortunately, though, catastrophic forgetting does occur under certain circumstances in distributed connectionist networks. The very features that give these networks their remarkable abilities to generalize, to function in the presence of degraded input, and so on, are found to be the root cause of catastrophic forgetting. The challenge in this field is to discover how to keep the advantages of distributed connectionist networks while avoiding the problem of catastrophic forgetting. In this article the causes, consequences and numerous solutions to the problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks are examined. The review will consider how the brain might have overcome this problem and will also explore the consequences of this solution for distributed connectionist networks.},

To accomplish this goal, we propose a different approach than currently used in research on gestures. We propose that meaning is central to the definition of &ldquo;gesture&rdquo; and discuss a new categorisation for gestures in which gestures refer (simultaneously) to four aspects, namely space, pathic information, symbols and emotion. This definition and categorisation also ask for a different type of experimentation. We show with two experiments how gestural human-computer interaction for product design can be studied. By having a trained artist mimic a gestural interface for design, we found that an accurate interpretation of the created product can be made, even when designers are allowed full freedom in their gestures. We find that task-specific intuitive human-computer interaction using gestures is feasible, although extensive research is necessary and ongoing},

After conducting an extensive review of Infovis systems and their interactive capabilities, we propose seven general categories of interaction techniques widely used in Infovis: 1) Select, 2) Explore, 3) Reconfigure, 4) Encode, 5) Abstract/Elaborate, 6) Filter, and 7) Connect. These categories are organized around a user's intent while interacting with a system rather than the low-level interaction techniques provided by a system. The categories can act as a framework to help discuss and evaluate interaction techniques and hopefully lay an initial foundation toward a deeper understanding and a science of interaction.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop a new method for analytically generating three-dimensional isocomfort workspace for the upper extremities using the robot kinematics. Subjective perceived discomfort scores in varying postures for manipulating four types of controls were used. Fifteen healthy male subjects participated in the experiment. The subjects were asked to hold the given postures manipulating controls for 60&#xa0;s in the seated position, and to rate their perceived discomfort during the following rest of 60&#xa0;s using the magnitude estimation. Postures of the upper extremities set by shoulder and elbow motions, types of controls, and left/right hand were selected as experimental variables, in which the L32 orthogonal array was adopted. The results showed that shoulder flexion and adduction-abduction, elbow flexion, and types of controls significantly affected perceived discomfort for postures operating controls, but hand used for operating controls did not. Depending upon the types of controls, four regression models predicting perceived discomfort were presented. Using the models, a sweeping algorithm to generate three-dimensional isocomfort workspace was developed, in which the robot kinematics was employed to describe the translational relationships between the upper arm and the lower arm/hand. It is expected that the isocomfort workspace can be used as a valuable design guideline when ergonomically designing three-dimensional workplaces.},

Features of the hand's motion are extracted from the sequence of segmented images, and when needed the hand's pose is classified using a neural net. This information is parsed by a task specific grammar. The system runs in real time on standard PC hardware. It has demonstrated its abilities with various users in several different office environments.

Human factors research delineates a subspace in which humans can operate without experiencing musculoskeletal strain, fatigue or discomfort. We claim that there is an even tighter space which we call the comfort zone. It is defined as the range of postures adopted voluntarily — despite the availability of other postures. We introduce a measurable, objective foundation for comfort, which was previously assumed equivalent to the absence of discomfort, a subjective quantity. Interfaces designed outside a user's comfort zone can prompt the adoption of alternative use patterns, which are often less favorable because they trade off the unnoticeable potential of injury for comfort. Designing interfaces within the limits of comfort zones can avert these risks.},

This promises to leverage our familiarity with the device without incurring the constraints of the bulky physics. This paper surveys technologies for alphanumeric input devices and methods with a strong focus on touch-typing. We analyze the characteristics of the keyboard modality and show how they contribute to making it a necessary complement to speech recognition rather than a competitor.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this quantitative, quasi-experimental study was to investigate the relationship between Kodály-based music instruction and reading fluency in first-grade classrooms. Reading fluency and overall reading achievement were measured for 109 participants at mid-point in the academic year pre- and post treatment. Tests were carried out to assess (a) the impact of Kodály-based music instruction on reading fluency, (b) potential gains in reading fluency resulting from Kodály-based music instruction, and (c) the extent and direction of causality between Kodály-based music instruction and overall reading achievement. A nonequivalent (pretest and posttest) control-group design was used to compare the means of posttest scores using an instrument (i.e., GORT-4) that measured both reading fluency and overall reading achievement for the experimental and control groups. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) allowed for the comparison of posttest fluency scores by holding constant pretest scores of the same variable. Statistical significance was found at the standard level (α = .05) and the idea that Kodály-based music instruction is related to reading fluency achievement was further advanced. Realized reading fluency gains were found in the 50 th and 75 th percentiles of the experimental group. Kodály-based music instruction appeared to have enhanced student performance as it moved students from below average to average ratings and average to above average ratings according to GORT-4 guidelines. Although there were differences between groups in posttest scores of overall reading achievement, the impact of music instruction on overall reading achievement was not found to be statistically significant. Thus, the extent and direction of causality between Kodály-based music instruction and reading achievement could not be strengthened by the study.},

Application domains in this direction involve virtual reality, augmented reality, wearable computing, and smart spaces, where gesturing is a possible method of interaction. This paper presents some important issues in choosing the set of gestures for the interface from a user-centred view such as the learning rate, ergonomics, and intuition. A procedure is proposed which includes those issues in the selection of gestures, and to test the resulting set of gestures. The procedure is tested and demonstrated on an example application with a small test group. The procedure is concluded to be useful for finding a basis for the choice of gestures. The importance of tailoring the gesture vocabulary for the user group was also shown.},

The ranking of algorithms and humans by accuracy, however, does not provide information about whether algorithms and humans perform the task comparably or whether algorithms and humans can be fused to improve performance. In this paper, we fused humans and algorithms using partial least square regression (PLSR). In the first experiment, we applied PLSR to face-pair similarity scores generated by seven algorithms participating in the Face Recognition Grand Challenge. The PLSR produced an optimal weighting of the similarity scores, which we tested for generality with a jackknife procedure. Fusing the algorithms' similarity scores using the optimal weights produced a twofold reduction of error rate over the most accurate algorithm. Next, human-subject-generated similarity scores were added to the PLSR analysis. Fusing humans and algorithms increased the performance to near-perfect classification accuracy. These results are discussed in terms of maximizing face-verification accuracy with hybrid systems consisting of multiple algorithms and humans.},

   abstract = {The use of hand gestures provides an attractive alternative to cumbersome interface devices for human-computer interaction (HCI). In particular, visual interpretation of hand gestures can help in achieving the ease and naturalness desired for HCI. This has motivated a very active research area concerned with computer vision-based analysis and interpretation of hand gestures. We survey the literature on visual interpretation of hand gestures in the context of its role in HCI. This discussion is organized on the basis of the method used for modeling, analyzing, and recognizing gestures. Important differences in the gesture interpretation approaches arise depending on whether a 3D model of the human hand or an image appearance model of the human hand is used. 3D hand models offer a way of more elaborate modeling of hand gestures but lead to computational hurdles that have not been overcome given the real-time requirements of HCI. Appearance-based models lead to computationally efficient &ldquo;purposive&rdquo; approaches that work well under constrained situations but seem to lack the generality desirable for HCI. We also discuss implemented gestural systems as well as other potential applications of vision-based gesture recognition. Although the current progress is encouraging, further theoretical as well as computational advances are needed before gestures can be widely used for HCI. We discuss directions of future research in gesture recognition, including its integration with other natural modes of human-computer interaction},

   pages = {2628-2636},
   abstract = {The active appearance model (AAM) is a powerful method for modeling and segmenting deformable visual objects. The utility of the AAM stems from two fronts: its compact representation as a linear object class and its rapid fitting procedure, which utilizes fixed linear updates. Although the original fitting procedure works well for objects with restricted variability when initialization is close to the optimum, its efficacy deteriorates in more general settings, with regards to both accuracy and capture range. In this paper, we propose a novel fitting procedure where training is coupled with, and directly addresses, AAM fitting in its deployment. This is achieved by simulating the conditions of real fitting problems and learning the best set of fixed linear mappings, such that performance over these simulations is optimized. The power of the approach does not stem from an update model with larger capacity, but from addressing the whole fitting procedure simultaneously. To motivate the approach, it is compared with a number of existing AAM fitting procedures on two publicly available face databases. It is shown that this method exhibits convergence rates, capture range and convergence accuracy that are significantly better than other linear methods and comparable to a nonlinear method, whilst affording superior computational efficiency.},

   abstract = {In earlier work, the authors analyzed emotion portrayals by professional actors separately for facial expression, vocal expression, gestures, and body movements. In a secondary analysis of the combined data set for all these modalities, the authors now examine to what extent actors use prototypical multimodal configurations of expressive actions to portray different emotions, as predicted by basic emotion theories claiming that expressions are produced by fixed neuromotor affect programs. Although several coherent unimodal clusters are identified, the results show only 3 multimodal clusters: agitation, resignation, and joyful surprise, with only the latter being specific to a particular emotion. Finding variable expressions rather than prototypical patterns seems consistent with the notion that emotional expression is differentially driven by the results of sequential appraisal checks, as postulated by componential appraisal theories.

   abstract = {A general inductive approach for analysis of qualitative evaluation data is described. The purposes for using an inductive approach are to (a) condense raw textual data into a brief, summary format; (b) establish clear links between the evaluation or research objectives and the summary findings derived from the raw data; and (c) develop a framework of the underlying structure of experiences or processes that are evident in the raw data. The general inductive approach provides an easily used and systematic set of procedures for analyzing qualitative data that can produce reliable and valid findings. Although the general inductive approach is not as strong as some other analytic strategies for theory or model development, it does provide a simple, straightforward approach for deriving findings in the context of focused evaluation questions. Many evaluators are likely to find using a general inductive approach less complicated than using other approaches to qualitative data analysis.},

   abstract = {Constructive algorithms have proved to be powerful methods for training feedforward neural networks. An important property of these algorithms is generalization. A series of empirical studies were performed to examine the effect of regularization on generalization in constructive cascade algorithms. It was found that the combination of early stopping and regularization resulted in better generalization than the use of early stopping alone. A cubic penalty term that greatly penalizes large weights was shown to be beneficial for generalization in cascade networks. An adaptive method of setting the regularization magnitude in constructive algorithms was introduced and shown to produce generalization results similar to those obtained with a fixed, user-optimized regularization setting. This adaptive method also resulted in the construction of smaller networks for more complex problems. The acasper algorithm, which incorporates the insights obtained from the empirical studies, was shown to have good generalization and network construction properties. This algorithm was compared to the cascade correlation algorithm on the Proben 1 and additional regression data sets},

   abstract = {Previous studies have linked action recognition with a particular pool of neurons located in the ventral premotor cortex, the posterior parietal cortex and the superior temporal sulcus (the mirror neuron system). However, it is still unclear if transitive and intransitive gestures share the same neural substrates during action-recognition processes. In the present study, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess the cortical areas active during recognition of pantomimed transitive actions, intransitive gestures, and meaningless control actions. Perception of all types of gestures engaged the right pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), and bilaterally in the posterior superior temporal cortex, the posterior parietal cortex, occipitotemporal regions and visual cortices. Activation of the posterior superior temporal sulcus/superior temporal gyrus region was found in both hemispheres during recognition of transitive and intransitive gestures, and in the right hemisphere during the control condition; the middle temporal gyrus showed activation in the left hemisphere when subjects recognized transitive and intransitive gestures; activation of the left inferior parietal lobe and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) was mainly observed in the left hemisphere during recognition of the three conditions. The most striking finding was the greater activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) during recognition of intransitive actions. Results show that a similar neural substrate, albeit, with a distinct engagement underlies the cognitive processing of transitive and intransitive gestures recognition. These findings suggest that selective disruptions in these circuits may lead to distinct clinical deficits.},
