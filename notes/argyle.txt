Argyle 1988


Non-verbal communication in animals:

- Ritualistic conduct in sexual readiness (primates)
- Play and pysical contact of various forms as greetings (primates)
- A variety of NVC signals to sign aggression or submission, including bristling of hair, aggressive vocalizations, facial expressions, motions and postures to denote power.

Gestures typically combined with other NVC (such as facial, vocal or tactile signals) to produce an 'overall display'

Goodall 1968 found chimps to use the following:
- Threats: Arms raised, hit towards others, flapping hands, shaking branch, slapping, stamping, throwing, waving
- Submission: bowing, bobbing, crouching
- Avoidance: flight, startle (duck head, hands across face), hiding, creeping away
- Frustration: Scratching, rocking, shaking branches, charging, slapping, stamping, throwing, leaping into air, hitting the ground, masturbation

Gestures fill the role of limited intentional movements; a demonstrate of intent without follow through in some instances; such as a creature making an aggressive gesture to express frustration or anger without having to actually fight (as they may be too busy or uninterested)

Pointing is a rare factor in chimp communicative gestures; although they are able to respond to it.

Like humans, most animals have some innate perspective on proxemics.

Postural position in animals reflects emotional states and attitudes
