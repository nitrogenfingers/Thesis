Section organiziation (notes for today's meeting):

Structuring of chapter 4, and how to tie the various threads of narrative together into a cohesive body:

System Development (the following points must be covered):

- Background:
    - Why a pointing interface?
    - Differences between relative and absolute pointing
    - Pros/cons of both approaches
    - Why we chose absolute pointing
- Implementation
    - The technology used (Kinect, hand devices etc.)       
    - Initial approach, 2D with no directionality, how this related to relative pointing
        - Coherent chunk; limitations specified, and why we dropped it. ALL in one section
    - Later approach, pointing with raycasting
    - Implementation behind raycasting
    - Adjusting for screen/kinect disparity
    - Assumptions made in implementation    
- Limitations of final system
    - Issues with initial system
    - Overcoming issues (moving to second system)
    - Technical limitations
    - Interface limitations
- Devices
    - Air mouse
    - Finger mouse
    - P5 Glove
    - Wand
    - Myo
- Testing

Questions:

- Discussion of how the interface was developed
    - Specification approach:
        - Interface
